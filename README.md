# EKO SHOOP!

## Introduction:

Hi my name is Tomaz Dobnik and this is my last project to build for the software developer diploma
at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).The idea for the project came from passion for the nature
surounded by us and how badly we impact on the inviroment arround us, with pollution and so much litter and plastic everywhere.
So I've decided to do something simple like an Eko-Shoop store where you can buy or find some idea or advice
how to reduce the use of plastic arround you and make our Planet greener.
